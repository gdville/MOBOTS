These files were the work of [Samuel R. Buss](http://euclid.ucsd.edu/~sbuss/ResearchWeb/ikmethods/index.html), providing variety of inverse kinematics approaches.

You will need to have OpenGL, GLUT and GLUI header files and libraries to compile and run these.  The programs run very fast on my home machine in Visual C++.NET and very slow on my office computer with Visual C++.6.0 (don't ask me why!), so your mileage may vary.  Bug reports appreciated, but the software is not being supported.
