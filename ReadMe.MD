#MOBOTS - Mars or Bust- Off the Shelf (robotic arm design and control for 3D Printing) 
This project originated to develop a 3D printing robotic arm for [NASA's 3D-Printed Habitat Challenge] (http://bradley.edu/challenge/). Baseline hardware utilizes the DoBot Magician. The software is forked from [Paul Morris Hill's Armour code](https://github.com/paulmorrishill/armour), designed to be a replacement for the software provided with the Dobot robotic arm.  See also the [Open Dobot Project](https://github.com/maxosprojects/open-dobot).
