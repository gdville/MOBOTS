#MOBOTS - Mars or Bust- Off the Shelf (robotic arm design and control for 3D Printing) 
This project originated to develop a 3D printing robotic arm for [NASA's 3D-Printed Habitat Challenge] (http://bradley.edu/challenge/). 

Additional documentation is located in the Wiki (select [Github Wiki tab](https://github.com/gdville/MOBOTS/wiki/Home)).

The hardware will need to be changed first, upgrading to MEGA+RAMPS controller with endstops, and extending the forearm and linkages.  The Repetier firmware is then modified with the repository code.
