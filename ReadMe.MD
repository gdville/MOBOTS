#MOBOTS - Mars or Bust- Off the Shelf (robotic arm design and control for 3D Printing) 
This project originated to develop a 3D printing robotic arm for [NASA's 3D-Printed Habitat Challenge] (http://bradley.edu/challenge/). Baseline hardware utilizes the DoBot Magician. The software is forked from the [Paul Morris Hill's Armour code](https://github.com/paulmorrishill/armour), designed to be a replacement for the software provided with the Dobot robotic arm.

#Firmware
This implementation uses G-Code as the arm control protocol and assumes that the arm is set up for one degree per mm.
Repetier firmware works pretty well, but any 3D printer firmware *should* work (but is not tested).

#Host software
Use [Repetier Host](http://www.repetier.com/download-now/).

#Dobot
The Dobot Magician is similar to the Dobot V1. Both are a 3 axis 4DOF arm configured as follows:

Extension of joints and alternative mounting configuration (inverted gantry and 90 degree bulkhead mounting) are also being explored.


##Hardware -Electrical
Dobot never made their system open source, so modifications are nearly impossible to the stock firmware and electronics.  Following other projects to make the Dobot system usable, the Dobot approach must upgrade to an Arduino MEGA 2560 with a RAMPS 1.4 driver board.

Here is a picture of the RAMPS board wired up to the Dobot outputs.

![ramps wiring](documentation/ramps-wiring.jpg)

To wire up the arm start by putting 3 jumpers across all 3 microstepping switches beneath each controller - this will set controllers to 16 times microstepping.

Then put the A4988 stepper drivers into the slots shown in the image and connect the stepper cables.

You'll need a 12V power supply for the RAMPS board, connected to the green connector in the image above. I used the one that came with the Dobot by chopping the jack off the end and wiring it in.

Also put a jumper across the middle and inner pins next to the servo connectors to power join the VCC to the servo VCC.

###Endstops
For some reason the people who made the Dobot decided not to implement any kind of end stop on the arm. I assume they intended to use the 2 axis angle sensors that are mounted on each segment. I couldn't find any code that would allow me to hook into these sensors so I opted for the simple route and put some physical end stops in. I'm also not sure how they intended to get over the gyroscope drift issue.

####Y and Z
![end-stops](documentation/end-stop-block.jpg)

The switch mounting block can be 3D printed from the stl file in dobot/HomeSwitchBlock.stl.

####X axis
The X is mounted to the bottom plate and uses a small roller wheel micro switch. The mount can be 3D printed from dobot/ArmXEndStop.stl

This mounting reduces the range of the X axis to about 250&deg; but it's worth it for a usable X end stop.

##Configuring the repetier firmware
- Download the [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) IDE if you don't already have it.
- Download the latest version of the [repetier firmware](http://www.repetier.com/documentation/repetier-firmware/).
- Open Repetier/Repetier.ino in Arduino
- Open configuration.h and overwrite it with the contents of dobot/Configuration.h
- Compile and program the arduino mega
- Open Repetier host and confirm that all the arm functions are working. Servos can be adjusted using [M340](http://reprap.org/wiki/Gcode#M340:_Control_the_servos)

# Running/Development
*To run this project you'll need visual studio. Set the start up project to "ConsoleArmControl". That is the main entry point at this stage.
Currently set up with

*When adding to the project where possible develop with TDD.

## Forward kinematics
The forward kinematics uses a series of Denavit-Hartenberg matricies with parameters specified by the arm being controlled. For now this is the Dobot arm parameters but could be any arm.

## Inverse kinematics
The inverse kinematics uses a hill climbing algorithm to identify the correct set of joint variables, with a randomized restart when a local maxima is reached.
