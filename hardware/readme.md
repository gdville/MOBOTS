#New Forearm 
The new forearm is approximately 4cm longer than the stock design.  You will need 2 with the second being a mirror image (i.e., countersinks and counterbores on opposite side). This part is intended to be machined from aluminum sheet metal. The two sides will be held together by the existing dowels in the Magician.

The linkages will also need to be extended by the same amount (pending).
